    "\n",
    "Your team is tasked with designing the operational protocol for a batch reactor (basically a tank) for a particular reaction that must be carried out in the absence of oxygen to reduce the formation of byproducts.  You have an idea to first fill the tank with nitrogen and then add the liquid mixture.  As the liquid mixture is added, part of the nitrogen gas will be removed to prevent pressure buildup.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To flush the oxygen out, the tank will initially be filled so that the nitrogen is at 298.15 K and 1.25 atm.  To keep oxygen out, you want to make sure that the pressure inside the tank remains greater than 1.0 atm after the liquid is added; however, the pressure should not become greater than 2.5 atm in order to keep the cost of the tank to a minimum.  The tank has a capacity of 4000 L, and depending upon the amount of product needed, the volume of liquid in the tank can range from 3000 to 3500 L.  In all cases, 25% of the nitrogen initially placed in the container remains after the tank is filled with the liquid.  Given these constraints determine the range of possible operating conditions (temperatures, volumes, and pressures) so that appropriate heat transfer and control equipment can be designed.  \n",

    "* You may assume that changes in the volume of liquid due to changes in temperature and pressure is negligible and the volatility of the liquid is low such that nitrogen is essentially the only component of the gas phase.\n",
    "* Remember that the number of moles, temperature, pressure, and volume of the gas are related by the ideal gas law.  You can only set three of the four variables independently.\n",
