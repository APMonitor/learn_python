    "    * $T_r = 300\\,K$\n",

    "    * $H_p(T_a) = y_{CO2}h_{CO2}(T_a) + y_{H2O}h_{H2O}(T_a) + y_{N2}h_{N2}(T_a)$.\n",

    "    * $h_i$ is computed using the thermo class. So, if ```t_CO2``` is my thermo class object for $CO_2$, then ```h_CO2=t_CO2.h_mass(T)```. \n",

    "**Description:**\n",
    "* We have a chemical reaction:\n",
    "    * $CH_4 + 2O_2 + 7.52N_2 \\rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O$ + 7.52$N_2$.\n",
    "* You can think of the burning as potential energy stored in the reactant bonds being released as kinetic energy in the products so the product temperature is higher.\n",
    "* Adiabatic means there is no enthalpy loss. You can think of enthalpy as energy. This means the products have the same enthalpy as the reactants. And this is just a statement that energy is conserved, like mass is.\n",
    "* The idea is to take a known reactant temperature, find the reactant enthalpy (which is an easy explicit equation you can calculate directly), then set the product enthalpy equal to the reactant enthalpy and find the corresponding product temperature (which is a harder nonlinear solve).\n",
    "    * $T_r\\rightarrow h_r = h_p \\rightarrow T_p$.\n",

    "    * We know the moles of reactants: $n_{ch4}=1$, $n_{O2}=2$, $n_{N2}=7.52$. \n",
    "    * So, we can compute the corresponding masses using the molecular weights.\n",
    "    * Then we sum the masses of each species to get the total mass, and compute the mass fractions.\n",
    "    * Then we can compute the enthalpy as $h=\\sum_iy_ih_i$. That is, the total enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpy per unit mass of each species times the mass fraction of each species.\n",
    "        * For reactants we have $h_r = y_{CH4}h_{CH4}+y_{O2}h_{O2}+y_{N2}h_{N2}$, where $h_i$ are evaluated using the class function h_mass(T), and T=300 for reactants.\n",
    "* Now, $h_p=h_r$. For products, we have $h_p = y_{CO2}h_{CO2}+y_{H2O}h_{H2O}+y_{N2}h_{N2}$, where we evaluate the class function h_mass(Tp), where Tp is the product temperature we are trying to compute.\n",
