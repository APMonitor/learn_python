    "## Temperature Control Lab for Python Introduction, Parts 3 and 4\n",
    "\n",
    "The TCLab (Temperature Control Lab) has an LED, two heaters, and two temperature sensors that are controlled with an Arduino. The heater power output is adjusted to maintain a desired temperature. Thermal energy from the heater is transferred by conduction, convection, and radiation to the temperature sensor. Heat is also transferred away from the device to the surroundings. This lab is a resource to learn data analysis, visualization, regression, and model analysis in Python with real data. Temperature control is an important problem in many applications such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintain temperature of a home during the winter\n",
    "* Pre-heat an oven for baking\n",
    "* Regulate the temperature in a chemical reactor\n",
    "* Reduce temperature variations during semiconductor production\n",
    "* Adjust the infrared heater for a newborn baby in an incubator to maintain body temperature\n",
    "* Regulate natural gas to a water heater to provide consistent hot water\n",
    "* Adjust flow through a heat exchanger to maintain outlet temperature\n",
    "* Others?\n",
    "\n",
    "The heaters and LED can be adjusted between 0-100% output. The heater effect is shown in the plot below.\n",
